                            <h3>Privacy Statement</h3>

                            Big Bir is committed to protecting your privacy and developing technology that gives you the most powerful and safe online
                            experience. This Statement of Privacy applies to the Big Bir Web site and governs data collection
                            and usage. By using the Big Bir website, you consent to the data practices described in this
                            statement.

                            <h4>Collection of your Personal Information</h4>
                            Big Bir collects personally identifiable information, such as your e-mail address, name, home or work address or telephone
                            number. Big Bir also collects anonymous demographic information, which is not unique to you,
                            such as your ZIP code, age, gender, preferences, interests and favorites. There is also information
                            about your computer hardware and software that is automatically collected by Big Bir. This information
                            can include: your IP address, browser type, domain names, access times and referring Web site
                            addresses. This information is used by Big Bir for the operation of the service, to maintain
                            quality of the service, and to provide general statistics regarding use of the Big Bir Web site.
                            Please keep in mind that if you directly disclose personally identifiable information or personally
                            sensitive data through Big Bir public message boards, this information may be collected and used
                            by others. Note: Big Bir does not read any of your private online communications. Big Bir encourages
                            you to review the privacy statements of Web sites you choose to link to from Big Bir so that
                            you can understand how those Web sites collect, use and share your information. Big Bir is not
                            responsible for the privacy statements or other content on Web sites outside of the Big Bir and
                            Big Bir family of Web sites.

                            <h4>Use of your Personal Information</h4>
                            Big Bir collects and uses your personal information to operate the Big Bir Web site and deliver the services you have requested.
                            Big Bir may also use your personally identifiable information to inform you of other products
                            or services available from Big Bir and its affiliates. Big Bir may also contact you via surveys
                            to conduct research about your opinion of current services or of potential new services that
                            may be offered. Big Bir does not sell, rent or lease its customer lists to third parties. Big
                            Bir may, from time to time, contact you on behalf of external business partners about a particular
                            offering that may be of interest to you. In those cases, your unique personally identifiable
                            information (e-mail, name, address, telephone number) is not transferred to the third party.
                            In addition, Big Bir may share data with trusted partners to help us perform statistical analysis,
                            send you email or postal mail, provide customer support, or arrange for deliveries. All such
                            third parties are prohibited from using your personal information except to provide these services
                            to Big Bir, and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information. Big Bir
                            does not use or disclose sensitive personal information, such as race, religion, or political
                            affiliations, without your explicit consent. Big Bir keeps track of the Web sites and pages our
                            customers visit within Big Bir, in order to determine what Big Bir services are the most popular.
                            This data may be used to deliver customized content and advertising within Big Bir to customers
                            whose behavior indicates that they are interested in a particular subject area. Big Bir Web sites
                            will disclose your personal information, without notice, only if required to do so by law or
                            in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law
                            or comply with legal process served on Big Bir or the site; (b) protect and defend the rights
                            or property of Big Bir; and, (c) act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety
                            of users of Big Bir, or the public.

                            <h4>Use of Cookies</h4>
                            The Big Bir Web site use "cookies" to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed
                            on your hard disk by a Web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses
                            to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server
                            in the domain that issued the cookie to you. One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide
                            a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that
                            you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you personalize Big Bir pages, or register
                            with Big Bir site or services, a cookie helps Big Bir to recall your specific information on
                            subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information, such as
                            billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on. When you return to the same Big Bir Web site,
                            the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the Big Bir features
                            that you customized. You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers automatically
                            accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer.
                            If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features
                            of the Big Bir services or Web sites you visit.

                            <h4>Security of your Personal Information</h4>
                            Big Bir secures your personal information from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. Big Bir secures the personally identifiable
                            information you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment, protected from
                            unauthorized access, use or disclosure. When personal information (such as a credit card number)
                            is transmitted to other Web sites, it is protected through the use of encryption, such as the
                            Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.

                            <h4>Changes to this Statement</h4>
                            Big Bir will occasionally update this Statement of Privacy to reflect company and customer feedback. Big Bir encourages you
                            to periodically review this Statement to be informed of how Big Bir is protecting your information.

                            <h4>Contact Information</h4>
                            Big Bir welcomes your comments regarding this Statement of Privacy. If you believe that Big Bir has not adhered to this Statement,
                            please contact Big Bir at 1-604-219-4738. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly
                            determine and remedy the problem.
